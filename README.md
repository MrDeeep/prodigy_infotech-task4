## Overview
Hii! I'm Joydip Ram and this repository contains the code and documentation for my data science internship project at Prodigy Infotech, focusing on Twitter sentiment analysis. The project aims to analyze sentiment patterns in Twitter data to gain insights into public opinion and attitudes towards various topics, brands, and events.

## Dataset
The dataset used for this project consists of Twitter data collected from Kaggle. It includes tweets related to various topics, brands, and events, providing a rich source of information for sentiment analysis.

## Methodology
- Data Collection: The Twitter dataset was sourced from Kaggle, ensuring a diverse range of tweets for analysis.
- Data Preprocessing: The data was cleaned and prepared for sentiment analysis to ensure accurate results.
- Sentiment Analysis: I employed natural language processing (NLP) techniques to analyze the sentiment of tweets.
                      Sentiment scores were calculated to classify tweets as positive, negative, or neutral.
- Company-Specific Analysis:
I conducted separate sentiment analyses for major companies, specifically Microsoft and Google. This involved filtering tweets related to each company and analyzing sentiment trends to understand public perception. The results highlighted how sentiments varied between the two companies, providing insights into their brand image and customer engagement.

## Conclusion
The sentiment analysis provides valuable insights into prevailing attitudes and opinions within the Twitter community regarding various topics. While negative sentiments appear to be more common overall, there is a diverse range of sentiments expressed across different topics.

Understanding these sentiment trends can inform decision-making processes, marketing strategies, and community engagement efforts in both online and offline contexts. The company-specific analyses for Microsoft and Google further illustrate how public sentiment can differ between brands, emphasizing the importance of monitoring social media for brand management.
